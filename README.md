# Token-extraction
Identifies each token in a string provided by the user. 

This Java program takes a single quoted string as a command-line argument and splits it into words based on spaces.
Each word is printed on a new line enclosed in square brackets (`[word]`). It uses a loop to find spaces in the string
and extracts substrings accordingly, processing all words until the end of the input.
